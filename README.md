## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

The goal is not only to build a predictive model, but also to implement industry-standard MLOps practices including reproducibility, experiment tracking, version control, and collaborative development.

# Running the Project

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svanaki/credit-card-fraud-mlops.git
cd credit-card-fraud-mlops
```

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

```bash
python src/prepare.py
```

## Model Training

```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Evaluation

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

## DVC Pipeline

The project uses DVC for:

- Raw and processed data versioning
- Model artifact versioning
- Shared Google Drive remote storage
- Reproducible pipeline execution
- Three pipeline stages:
  - prepare
  - train
  - evaluate

Retrieve the DVC-managed artifacts with:

```bash
dvc pull
```

> **Note**
>
> This project uses a shared Google Drive DVC remote for versioning datasets and model artifacts.

> Access to the remote storage is restricted to project team members. Users without permission can still clone the repository and review the complete source code, DVC pipeline configuration, and documentation, but `dvc pull` requires access to the shared DVC remote.

> For evaluation purposes, the repository includes the complete pipeline implementation (`dvc.yaml`, `dvc.lock`, source code, and documentation). The remote storage is used only for sharing DVC-managed artifacts among project collaborators.

## MLflow

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

Open

## MLflow Experiment Tracking

MLflow was used to track and compare multiple Logistic Regression experiments.

The following experiments were conducted:

| Experiment | C | Solver |
|------------|---:|--------|
| Baseline | 1.0 | lbfgs |
| Experiment 1 | 0.1 | lbfgs |
| Experiment 2 | 10.0 | lbfgs |

For each experiment, MLflow logs:

- Parameters
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- PR-AUC
- Trained model
- Evaluation artifacts

---

## DVC Pipeline

The project uses DVC for:

- Dataset versioning
- Pipeline reproducibility
- Pipeline stages:
  - prepare
  - train
  - evaluate

Additional documentation is available in:

- docs/dvc_remote.md
